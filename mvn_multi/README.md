Sample Maven multi-module project to be used as guinea pig for Clojure POC.

 * parent - has modules, common properties and dependencies
  * domain - POJOs
  * service - services
  * rest - main class, rest endpoints

## TODO
1.  Run with spring boot command runner
2.  Add simple GET endpoints to simulate rest module change (nothing else should be build)
